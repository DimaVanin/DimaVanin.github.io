				<p>In v2.0 of the Graph API, calling /me/friends returns the person's friends who also use the app.</p>

				<p>In addition, in v2.0, you must request the user_friends permission from each user.
					user_friends is no longer included by default in every login.
					Each user must grant the user_friends permission in order to appear in the response to /me/friends.
					See the Facebook upgrade guide for more detailed information, or review the summary below.</p>

				<p>If you want to access a list of non-app-using friends, there are two options:</p>

				<p> 1) If you want to let your people tag their friends in stories that they publish to Facebook
					using your App, you can use the /me/taggable_friends API. Use of this endpoint requires review by Facebook
					and should only be used for the case where you're rendering a list of friends in order to let the user tag
					them in a post.
				</p>

				<p> 2)If your App is a Game AND your Game supports Facebook Canvas, you can use the /me/invitable_friends
					endpoint in order to render a custom invite dialog, then pass the tokens returned by this API to the
					standard Requests Dialog.
				</p>

				<p>In other cases, apps are no longer able to retrieve the full list of a user's friends (only those friends
					who have specifically authorized your app using the user_friends permission). This has been confirmed by
					Facebook as 'by design'.
				</p>

				<p>For apps wanting allow people to invite friends to use an app, you can still use the Send Dialog on Web or
					the new Message Dialog on iOS and Android.
				</p>

				<p>UPDATE: Facebook have published an FAQ on these changes here:
					https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/faq which explain all the options available to developers in order
					to invite friends etc.
