                <p>In v2.0 of the Graph API, calling <strong>/me/friends</strong> returns the person's friends who also
                    use the app.</p>

                <p>In addition, in v2.0, you must request the <em>user_friends</em> permission from each user.
                    <em>user_friends</em> is no longer included by default in every login. Each user must grant the
                    user_friends permission in order to appear in the response to <strong>/me/friends</strong>. See the
                    <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/upgrading#upgrading_v2_0_user_ids"
                       target="_blank">Facebook upgrade guide</a> for more detailed information, or review the summary
                    below.</p>

                <p>If you want to access a list of non-app-using friends, there are two options:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>1) If you want to let your people tag their friends in stories that they publish to Facebook
                        using your App, you can use the <strong>/me/taggable_friends</strong> API. Use of this endpoint
                        requires review by Facebook and should only be used for the case where you're rendering a list
                        of friends in order to let the user tag them in a post.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <blockquote>
                    <p> 2)If your App is a Game AND your Game supports Facebook Canvas, you can use the
                        <strong>/me/invitable_friends</strong> endpoint in order to render a custom invite dialog, then
                        pass the tokens
                        returned by this API to the standard Requests Dialog.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>In other cases, apps are no longer able to retrieve the full list of a user's friends (only those
                    friends who have specifically authorized your app using the user_friends permission). This has been
                    confirmed by Facebook as 'by design'.
                </p>

                <p>For apps wanting allow people to invite friends to use an app, you can still use the Send Dialog on
                    Web or the new Message Dialog on iOS and Android. </p>

                <p>UPDATE: Facebook have published an FAQ on these changes here:
                    <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/faq" target="_blank">
                        https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/faq</a>
                    which explain all the options available to developers
                    in order to invite friends etc.
